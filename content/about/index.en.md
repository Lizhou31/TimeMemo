## About me
### The Possibly Professional Side

I graduated from university with a degree in electrical engineering and telecommunications, so I guess I have _some_ knowledge in these areas -- at the very least, I know that a computer has to be connected to the internet before it can actually _use_ the internet.

That said, I spent a lot of time dabbling in things outside my major, which means I'm not particularly _specialized_ in my field. More often than not, I find myself scrambling to learn things on the spot when they come up at work.

Right now, I plan to dive deeper into the following topics:

* __Embedded systems development__, especially focusing on __embedded operating systems__
* __AI-related fields__, with a particular interest in __Edge AI__
* __Probability and statistics__, particularly __Bayesian statistics__

Of course, I'm interested in plenty of other things as well -- space exploration, drone systems, the transformation of automotive technology, various software development paradigms, design patterns, you name it.

Basically, I'm the kind of person who drifts between random fields out of sheer curiosity.

If I had to sum it up: My work constantly reminds me of how much I donâ€™t know, which then makes me think, Oh, maybe I should learn about this, and before I know it, here I am -- chasing after yet another topic.

### The Possibly Leisure Side
At the end of 2022, I bought a second-hand __Sony A7M2__ full-frame camera with a __28-70mm zoom lens__. Later on, I added a __55mm prime lens__, and thus began my fateful descent into the world of __Sony cameras__.

To be honest, I had been interested in photography for a long time, but the reason I finally did the research and bought a camera? __To take portraits of a girl.__ (Look at that 55mm lens -- clearly meant for portraits.)

~Too bad the girl wouldn't let me take her photos.~

So in the end, I decided to focus on landscapes instead. At least the sunset won't refuse to be photographed... right? (_wipe tears_)

Anyway, my current goal is to use my existing gear (though I might pick up a wide-angle prime lens later) to capture the world as I see it -- learning to tell stories through the lens.

Aside from photography, I've also been working out regularly. Not aiming to become a muscle-bound gym bro (not that I could even if I tried, QQ), but just keeping myself in decent shape and staying healthy. As long as I don't hate what I see in the mirror, I'll count that as a win. XD

Oh, and I also bought a second-hand digital piano from a friend... but it's been sitting at my parents' house collecting dust because I never actually got around to bringing it home. What was originally meant to be a fun little hobby has turned into _room decor_ -- and my mom won't stop nagging me about it.

_January 2025 Update_

After two years of eventful life experiences (?), I've now upgraded to an A7C, and my lens setup has changed to a 28-75mm f/2.8 zoom and a 35mm f/1.4 prime. So... congratulations to me?

Not sure if my photography skills have improved, but at least my gear has. lol

### Final Thoughts
This website is my attempt to build something I've never really had before -- a record of my journey, whether in learning, life, or personal growth.

By forcing myself to document things, I'm also forcing myself to actually follow through on all those things I keep procrastinating on. Keeping myself busy, staying productive, and hopefully caring less about unnecessary distractions.

Maybe, one day, I'll even look back on this and read it as a bedtime story to kids.
